I am interested in understanding how incoming visual inputs can activate a previously saved template in the brain for ecologically relevant stimuli, like faces. Using fMRI and psychophysical techniques, my research focuses on studying how prior knowledge and high-level face-specialised mechanisms can sharpen orientation selective response in V1.

I completed my MSc in Neuroscience from National Brain Research Centre (India), specializing in Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience.

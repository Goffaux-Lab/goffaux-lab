I'm a PhD student in the lab. My research interests revolve around the fundamental mechanisms underlying the visual system. 
During my Masters in Psychology at the University of Amsterdam, I conducted research into the visual system using a visual peripheral illusion known as the uniformity illusion. 
My current research focuses on the recurring coarse-to-fine processing of faces across the visual system, using techniques such as MRI (3T and 7T) and psychophysics.

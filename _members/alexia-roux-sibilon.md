In my research, I use experimental psychology techniques and visual psychophysics to study human visual perception. I am particularly interested in our peripheral vision (what we see on the sides of our visual field) and how this information is processed and blends with what we look at directly.
As a postdoc researcher in the lab, my research focuses on understanding how we perceive and recognise human faces at fixation and in our peripheral vision. Prior to this, I received my PhD in Psychology and Cognitive Science from University Grenoble-Alpes (France) where I examined the role of peripheral vision in coarse-to-fine theories of visual recognition.
I am also interested in how basic mechanisms of visual perception may vary across different human cultures.

Since 2013, Valerie Goffaux is leading the [humanvisionlab](https://goffaux-lab.github.io/goffaux-lab/) at UCLouvain (Belgium). By means of psychophysics, neuroimaging and electrophysiological methods, her research aims at understanding how the human brain solves the complex task of face perception.

She completed her PhD at UCLouvain (Belgium) under the supervision of Profs. Raymond Bruyer and Bruno Rossion. After postdoctoral fellowships at UCLouvain with Prof. Rossion, at Maastricht University with Prof. Goebel, at the University of Luxembourg with Prof. Schiltz, and at the KULeuven (Belgium) with Prof. Op de Beeck, she obtained a F.R.S.-F.N.R.S. Research Associate position to pursue her research on human face perception.

The efficiency of human face processing is thought to build upon the complex visual mechanisms operated by high-level face-specialized visual regions. How high-level and complex face representations emerge in the human brain is however still largely elusive. The work of Valerie Goffaux suggests that high-level face-specialized visual processing is empowered by dynamic and recurrent interactions with primary visual regions encoding basic dimensions of the visual input such as orientation and spatial frequency.

        <p>The human face conveys a wealth of complex information (e.g., identity, gaze, emotion, gender, etc.) critical for social interactions. Despite face information being conveyed via subtle luminance variations on the retina, its analysis by most human visual systems is fast and accurate.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to understand how the human brain solves the complex task of face perception. By means of psychophysical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging techniques, we explore what, when, and where face information is integrated in the brain to yield rich and complex face percepts.</p>

- **Oct 2024:** Our latest research paper ["Horizontal face information is the main gateway to the shape and surface cues to familiar face identity"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311225) is now published in PLOS One!
- **Aug 2024:** Our lab attended the European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP) in Aberdeen, Scotland. Feel free to peruse our presentations [here](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/GoffauxLab-Valerie-Goffaux).
- **Dec 2023:** Kudos to [Dr. Jolien Schuurmans](https://goffaux-lab.github.io/goffaux-lab/members/jolien-schuurmans.html) on successfully defending her PhD thesis!
- **Nov 2023:** Congratulations to [Dr. Umut Canoluk](https://goffaux-lab.github.io/goffaux-lab/members/umut-canoluk.html) for successfully defending his PhD thesis!

We are always open to applications from motivated individuals interested in joining our lab. Whether you're looking for an internship or a Master's thesis, we have various projects available! Below are some areas of research we are currently working on:

- How does flipping a face upside down confuse the brain, and (how) is this disruption reflected in neural activity? Contact [Mrittika Dey](https://goffaux-lab.github.io/goffaux-lab/members/mrittika-dey.html) if you are interested in learning more.
- Does the radial bias influence fast saccades towards faces in the periphery ? Contact [Marius Grandjean](https://goffaux-lab.github.io/goffaux-lab/members/marius-grandjean.html) if you are interested in learning more.

We are also looking for candidates to apply for PhD funding with us! Please contact [Valérie Goffaux](https://goffaux-lab.github.io/goffaux-lab/members/valerie-goffaux.html) to discuss possible topics!

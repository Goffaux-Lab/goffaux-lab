# SF Processing

Spatial frequencies (SF) refer to the different spatial resolutions composing an image, with low SF depicting the coarse structure of the image and higher SF representing its finest details. Natural images exhibit luminance variations aligned across a broad SF spectrum. Coarse-to-fine theories of vision propose that the coarse information carried by the low spatial frequencies (LSF) of visual input guides the integration of finer, high spatial frequency (HSF) detail.

  text="Using functional resonance imaging (fMRI), we disrupted the processing of the coarse and fine content of full-spectrum human face stimuli via backward masking of selective SF ranges (LSFs: < 1.75cpd and HSFs: > 1.75cpd) at specific times (50, 83, 100 or 150 ms). In line with coarse-to-fine proposals, we found that (1) the selective masking of stimulus LSF disrupted V1 activity in the earliest time window, and progressively decreased in influence, while (2) an opposite trend was observed for the masking of stimulusâ€™ HSF. This pattern of activity was found in V1, as well as in ventral (i.e. the Fusiform Face area, FFA), dorsal and orbitofrontal regions."

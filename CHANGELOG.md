### Changed

- Template is no longer limited to GitHub Pages white-listed Jekyll plugins. Any plugins possible.
- Pull request previews happen right within GitHub instead of needing Netlify.
- Better versioning. `CITATION.cff` file now source of truth for version, and tags/releases enforced.
- Citation-related files in `/_data` must now be named prefixed with the cite plugin they are to be run with, e.g. `sources-2020.yaml` or `orcid-students.yaml`.
- Folder renames for clarity and for better separation of template and user content: `/auto-cite` → `/_cite`, `/css` → `/_styles`, `/js` → `/_scripts`.
- Rename "Tools" page to "Projects" to be more clear and general purpose.
- Rename `extra-links` to `buttons` in `sources.yaml` files.
- Rename `theme.scss` to `-theme.scss`.
- Rename/repurpose components: link → button, two-col → cols, gallery → grid.
- Combine "link" and "role" data lists into single `types.yaml` map.
- Redesign components, change parameters and behavior.
- Update Font Awesome icon names from v5 to v6.
- Change placeholder text, images, and other images.
- Use CSS variables instead of Sass variables.
